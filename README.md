# Themoelectric.py ‚Äî A python tool for design of high ZT nanoengineered thermoelectrics
<div align="justify">
 
*Thermoelectric.py* is a computational framework that computes electron transport coefficients with unique features to design the nanoscale morphology of thermoelectrics (TEs) to obtain electron scattering that will enhance performance through electron energy filtering. The code uses the semiclassical Boltzmann transport equation to compute the TE properties of electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, electron contribution to thermal conductivity, etc., under relaxation time approximation. The code has an interface with the VASP ab initio simulation package. What distinguishes *Thermoelectric.py* from other software such as *BoltzTrap* is sets of subtools that are implemented assist in modeling electron transport in semiconductors. These include a tool for self-consistent calculation of the Fermi level from a given carrier concentration, and a fast algorithm that uses Fermi‚Äôs golden rule to compute the energy dependent electron scattering rate due nanoparticles, pores and grain boundaries. The first of these subtools circumvent the problem that DFT underestimates the band gaps, and the second performs isosurface integrals to enable very dense but numerically efficient Brillouin Zone mesh sampling.

Thermoelectrics (TE) are a class of materials that convert heat directly into electricity. The performance of TE materials at a given temperature, ùëá, is quantified by a dimensionless figure of merit ZT=(œÉS<sup>2</sup>)/Œ∫ T, where Œ∫, œÉ and S are the material‚Äôs thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient, respectively. The power factor (œÉS<sup>2</sup>) in ZT depends on a combination of strongly interdependent electrical transport properties, that have a countervailing dependence of the charge carrier concentration. The tradeoff of these parameters is well understood, and it has become an accepted truth that optimal TE performance can only be obtained in semiconductors that are highly doped to a narrow window of optimized charge carrier concentration. If made sufficiently efficient and inexpensive, these materials could be used to recapturing low-grade waste heat from industrial process as useful electrical energy. The potential energy savings are vast. Recent studies have suggested that recuperating only 10% of heat lost into electricity can improve fuel energy efficiency by 20% while other studies has reported that more than 68% of U.S. energy consumption escaped as waste heat.

The electrical conductivity and thermopower of a population of independent charge carriers can be derived from the Boltzmann transport equation by integrating the contribution from all carrier states. In an isotropic system where the states can be enumerated by their energy, and using the single relaxation time approximation for the collision operator, these can be written as integrals over the carrier energy, E, so that œÉ, S, and Œ∫<sub>e</sub> are given by

The Fermi level depends strongly on the carrier concentration, which varies non-monotonically with temperature as the solubility of the dopant changes. For a given carrier concentration, a self-consistent approach is developed to compute E<sub>f</sub> by setting the conduction band edge as the reference frame and computing E<sub>f</sub> that gives the same carrier population in DFT computed band and the given carrier population. This circumvents the problem that DFT underestimates the band gap. In this method Joyce and Dixon approximation of E<sub>f</sub> for degenerate semiconductors ((E<sub>f</sub>-E<sub>c</sub>)/k<sub>B</sub> ‚âÖln‚Å°[(n/N<sub>c</sub>)+1/(‚àö8)]n/N<sub>c</sub> -(3/16-‚àö3/9) (n/N<sub>c</sub>)<sup>2</sup>) is used as the initial guess.

This equation accounts for both absorption and emission of phonons. Note that the electron lifetime is strongly dominated by ion scattering and has weak dependency on phonon scattering. The other scattering terms of electron-electron and electron intervalley scattering has negligible importance in determining the electron lifetime and are excluded in calculations without loss of accuracy.

For ideal or perfect filtering, a high rate of additional scattering would be applied to all the electrons with energy lower than a certain threshold, Uo, so as to reduce their drift velocity to zero. The calculated change in the room temperature PF of n-doped silicon that would be provided by with ideal
filtering is plotted in Figure 1 as a function of filtering threshold, U , and carrier concentration. The key result of this calculation is that if one can control the filtering threshold, the best power performance is to be found at high carrier.

### Effect of Nanopores on Lorenz Number

When advocating for increased carrier concentration in TEs, it is important to determine whether this will cause a significant increase to the denominator of ZT. Hence, we finish our examination of the effect of pores on the room-temperature electrical transport coefficients by briefly discussing the electronic thermal conductivity (Œ∫e). The Œ∫e is related to œÉ by Wiedemann Franz law as Œ∫e = LTœÉ. Here, L is the Lorenz number that conventionally varies from 2 √ó (kB/e)2 ‚âà
1.48 √ó 10‚àí8(V2/K2) up to œÄ2/3 √ó (kB/e)2 ‚âà 2.44 √ó 10‚àí8(V2/K2) for the low carrier concentration and degenerate (free electron) limit, respectively.
Lorenz number is related to the moments of the charge carriers, Œîn, through L = 1/(eT)2(Œî2 ‚àíŒî21). In bulk Si, the Lorenz number varies monotonically from
1.53 √ó 10‚àí8 (V2/K2) at 1019 1/cm3 to 2.39 √ó 10‚àí8 (V2/K2) at 1021 1/cm3 . Figure 6 shows the variation of Lorenz number The objective of adding porosity is to lower the lattice thermal conductivity, and prior studies by Romano3 and others32 have shown that the lattice thermal conductivity in nanoporous Si with the geometries modeled here can be as low as ‚àº30 W/m/ K at room temperature. At bulk room temperature, Si with the carrier concentration tuned to optimize ZT, the electronic thermal conductivity is ‚àº0.3 W/m/KÓÉïstill 2 orders of magnitude lower than the lattice conductivity.
