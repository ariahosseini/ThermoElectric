Welcome to ThermoElectric's documentation!
=========================================================
ThermoElectric is a computational framework that computes electron transport coefficients with unique features to design
the nanoscale morphology of thermoelectric (TE) materials to obtain electron scattering that will enhance performance
through electron energy filtering. The code uses the linear Boltzmann transport equation to compute the electrical
properties of electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, electron thermal conductivity, etc., under relaxation time
approximation. The code has an interface with the VASP ab initio simulation package. What distinguishes ThermoElectric
from other software such as BoltzTrap is sets of sub-tools that are implemented assist in modeling electron transport
in semiconductors. These include a tool for self-consistent calculation of the Fermi level from a given carrier
concentration, and a fast algorithm that uses Fermiâ€™s golden rule to compute the energy dependent electron scattering
rate due nano-particles, nanoscale pores and grain boundaries. The first of these sub-tools circumvent the problem that
DFT underestimates the band gaps, and the second performs iso-surface integrals to enable very dense but numerically
efficient Brillouin Zone mesh sampling.
