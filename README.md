# THEORY

<div align="justify">
 
Thermoelectrics (TE) are a class of materials that convert heat directly into electricity. The performance of TE materials at a given temperature, ùëá, is quantified by a dimensionless figure of merit ZT=(œÉS<sup>2</sup>)/Œ∫ T, where Œ∫, œÉ and S are the material‚Äôs thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient, respectively. The power factor (œÉS<sup>2</sup>) in ZT depends on a combination of strongly interdependent electrical transport properties, that have a countervailing dependence of the charge carrier concentration. The tradeoff of these parameters is well understood, and it has become an accepted truth that optimal TE performance can only be obtained in semiconductors that are highly doped to a narrow window of optimized charge carrier concentration. If made sufficiently efficient and inexpensive, these materials could be used to recapturing low-grade waste heat from industrial process as useful electrical energy. The potential energy savings are vast. Recent studies have suggested that recuperating only 10% of heat lost into electricity can improve fuel energy efficiency by 20% while other studies has reported that more than 68% of U.S. energy consumption escaped as waste heat.

The electrical conductivity and thermopower of a population of independent charge carriers can be derived from the Boltzmann transport equation by integrating the contribution from all carrier states. In an isotropic system where the states can be enumerated by their energy, and using the single relaxation time approximation for the collision operator, these can be written as integrals over the carrier energy, E, so that œÉ, S, and Œ∫<sub>e</sub> are given by

## Model Fermi Level

<div align="justify">
  
<p>
The Fermi level depends strongly on the carrier concentration, which varies non-monotonically with temperature as the solubility of the dopant changes. For a given carrier concentration, a self-consistent approach is developed to compute E<sub>f</sub> by setting the conduction band edge as the reference frame and computing E<sub>f</sub> that gives the same carrier population in DFT computed band and the given carrier population. This circumvents the problem that DFT underestimates the band gap. In this method Joyce and Dixon approximation of E<sub>f</sub> for degenerate semiconductors ((E<sub>f</sub>-E<sub>c</sub>)/k<sub>B</sub> ‚âÖln‚Å°[(n/N<sub>c</sub>)+1/(‚àö8)]n/N<sub>c</sub> -(3/16-‚àö3/9) (n/N<sub>c</sub>)<sup>2</sup>) is used as the initial guess.

Semiconductor TEs are generally doped to beyond their saturation level. In these materials, strongly screened Columbic force induced by ionized impurities is the main source of scattering.

While the electron lifetime in equation serves reasonably well for many semiconductors, one should note two shortcomings of the Born approximation failures for slow moving electrons in Coulomb potential and deficiency of simply computing scattering from a single impurity and then multiplying it by number of impurities in capturing interference effects occur as electron wave propagate through random distribution of impurities in deriving this equation. We model the conduction band effective mass variation with temperature using m<sub>c</sub>(T)=m<sub>c</sub><sup>*</sup>(1+5Œ±k<sub>B</sub> T).

This equation accounts for both absorption and emission of phonons. Note that the electron lifetime is strongly dominated by ion scattering and has weak dependency on phonon scattering. The other scattering terms of electron-electron and electron intervalley scattering has negligible importance in determining the electron lifetime and are excluded in calculations without loss of accuracy.

## Model Electron Transport Coefficients In Nanostructured Thermoelectrics

<p>
In the nanostructured of interest in this study, there are two additional electron scattering processes that arise as a result of the morphology: electron scattering at grain boundaries, and scattering from pores. The rate of electron momentum relaxation due to elastic scattering from a uniform dispersion of pores can be modeled as

Here N is the number density of pores, and the term SR<sub>kk'</sub> is the rate of transition of an electron from an initial state with wave vector k and energy E to a state k' with energy E' due to a single pore.

<p>The terms D(E), and ŒΩ(E) for Si were derived from the conduction band of Si computed with density functional theory (DFT) using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) using generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew-Burke-Erzerhof exchange correlation functional (PBE). Projector augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotentials is used represent the ion cores. The Kohm-Sham wave functions constructed using a planewave basis set with 700 eV energy cutoff.

### Maximum enhancement in power factor 
<div align="justify">
  
<p> This panel shows the model prediction for the variation in larges achievable TE power factor with carrier concentration in Si based porous materials with optimal characteristic lengths at 300 K. The best power factor performance using ideal filtering model is plotted in green. The power factor in bulk Si is plotted in black. In the narrow carrier concentration window with the highest power factor, bulk Si shows slightly better performance. The large energy difference between the conduction band edge in the Si and the vacuum level in the pore (about 4.15 eV electron affinity of bulk Si) causes strong electron scattering with countervailing response of reduction in the electrical conductivity and enhancement of Seebeck coefficient that cancel out each other, leading to an overall unchanged PF value. The maximum PF in porous structures takes place at carrier concentrations higher than the optimal carrier concentration in bulk Si. This is a key insight for the design of thermoelectrics at room temperature: If one is planning to engineer porous thermoelectrics to reduce phonon conduction, then one should also plan to increase the carrier concentration above the optimal level for the bulk semiconductor. In the Si model the maximum power factor of porous materials takes place at 8√ó10<sup>19</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup> carrier concentration and is slightly less than the maximum power factor in bulk Si occurs at 6.3x10<sup>19</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup> (~25% increase in doing concentration is needed for the best performance in porous Si).  </p>
