ThermoElectric
=========================================================
ThermoElectric is a computational framework that computes electron transport coefficients with unique features to design
the nanoscale morphology of thermoelectric (TE) materials to obtain electron scattering that will enhance performance
through electron energy filtering. The code uses the linear Boltzmann transport equation to compute the electrical
properties of electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, electron thermal conductivity, etc., under relaxation time
approximation.

Installation
=========================================================
::

   gh repo clone ariahosseini/ThermoElectric
   cd ThermoElectric
   sudo python setup.py install
